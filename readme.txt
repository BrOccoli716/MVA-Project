This is a course project from the Database course I have taken at Tsinghua University during my undergraduate years.

This project aims to provide multi-variate statistical analysis of the 2022 Qatar FIFA World Cup data. In the project, I used Factor Analysis to interpret the performance of football teams. Then I used Canonical Correlation Analysis to find the relationship between different factors. After that, I used k-means clustering methods to find football teams with higher similarity and made explanation about the result. Finally, I constructed a linear regression model based on the extracted factors, which can accurately predict the winning rate of a football match and corresponds to the real-world cases.

Since I took the course in China, the documents are mainly in Chinese, about which I feel really sorry for the inconvenience. But the pictures and codes are understandable.
